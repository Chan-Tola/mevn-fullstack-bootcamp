what is rest api ?
=> Rest api is Unuiform interface: the inteface between cline and servers is shoudl uniform 
and well-defined. User standard HTTP methods (GET,POST,PUT,DELETE) to perform
operation on the resource, and data exchange canbe JSON and XML.

One more thing : it is stateless,so the main meaning is when request from a client to servers
must contain all the information that is necessary to understand and fulfill the request. The server
do not maintain the state between requests.

HTTP method :
GET : Retrieve a resource
POST : create a new resource
PUT: Update an existing resource (can be update all)
DELETE : delete a resource
PATCH : update partly a resource

URLs : the way we acess resource
